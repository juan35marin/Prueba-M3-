designed for an event organizer
you can manage a series of events based on the availability of venues and attendees (I had a lot of problems with javascript, sorry for the little).

## 🚀 Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juan35marin/Prueba-M3-.git
   cd Prueba-M3
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. You can navigate between the discs, see the description, about the author or contact.

---

## 🎨 Personalization

- Add or modify disks by creating new files `discoX.html` and adding their images in the `images /` folder.
- Edit `style.css` and `style1.css` to change design, typography, colors, or make it responsive.
- Adjust `contact.html` if you want to integrate a functional form.

---

## 📌 Future recommendations

- Add JavaScript files for interaction (dynamic navigation, sliders, forms).
- Convert to responsive site using media queries in CSS.
- Implement a real form with back-end (PHP, Node.js, etc.).
- Optimize images to improve loading times.
- Automate the generation of disk pages with a static generator (Jekyll, Hugo ...).
